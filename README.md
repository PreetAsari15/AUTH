# AUTH
  
This is a Node.js app I built to implement **Basic Authentication** using Express.js. It covers the basics of registering users, logging in, and protecting routes with HTTP Basic Auth. If you're exploring authentication like me, this might be helpful!

### Features

- **User Registration**: Store user credentials securely in memory (or extend to a database).
- **User Login**: Authenticate users with their username and password.
- **Protected Routes**: Secure specific endpoints using Basic Authentication.

### What It Does

- **User Registration**: Add new users (stored in memory for now, but you can expand it later).
- **User Login**: Authenticate with a username and password.
- **Protected Routes**: Access secured endpoints only after logging in.
